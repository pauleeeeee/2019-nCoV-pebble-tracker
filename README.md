# 2019-nCoV-pebble-tracker
Pebble smartwatch app that shows you the nearest outbreak location and number of cases. This app shows you the nearest outbreak of the COVID 19 (2019-nCoV) virus aka 'Coronavirus' to your location. The data is supplied by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE) (https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). In the latest version (v2.0.0 onward), the same data is pulled, but instead from this endpoint: https://github.com/novelcovid/api

The datasource is updated fairly frequently - as often as every 10 minutes for world data. Some data is updated just once daily, around 23:59 (UTC).

If your country has province / state level data... your nearest province or state will be shown on the first screen. Then you can press down to scroll to your country's data and then again to the world's data.
